## 📌 Datasets Used

The dataset was taken from Kaggle: [Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india).
It contains two files:

1. **Unemployment in India.csv** – Detailed dataset with Region, Date, Area, Employment, Labour Participation, etc.
2. **Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv** – Simplified dataset with Region, Date, Frequency, and Unemployment Rate.

* Cleaned column names (removed spaces).
* Checked missing values and dataset info.
* Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📊 Visualizations

### File 1: *Unemployment in India.csv*

* **Line Chart**: Unemployment Rate Over Time by Region
* **Bar Chart**: Average Unemployment Rate by Region

### File 2: *Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv*

* **Line Chart**: Unemployment Rate Trend During 2020 by Region
* **Bar Chart**: Average Unemployment Rate by Region

## ✅ Conclusion

* Both datasets show clear fluctuations in unemployment rates across different regions.
* The unemployment rate significantly increased during the early phase of Covid-19 in 2020.
* Regional differences indicate some states were more affected than others.
