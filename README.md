# CodeAlpha Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains the projects I have completed during my **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.
The internship focused on practical machine learning tasks, data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed

### âœ… Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

* Used the classic **Iris dataset** with features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
* Trained a machine learning model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest) to classify flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**.
* Achieved good accuracy with scikit-learn models.
* **Files:**

  * `iris_classification.py`
  * `README.md`

### âœ… Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

* Analyzed unemployment datasets from Kaggle (`Unemployment in India.csv` and `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`).
* Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
* Visualized **unemployment rate trends** over time and region-wise average unemployment.
* Compared pre-Covid vs Covid trends in unemployment.
* **Files:**

  * `unemployment_analysis.py`
  * `README.md`

### âœ… Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

* Built a regression model to predict **selling price of cars**.
* Dataset contained 301 cars with features like **Year, Present Price, Driven Kms, Fuel Type, Transmission, Owner, etc.**
* Applied data preprocessing (one-hot encoding), train-test split, and **Linear Regression model**.
* Evaluation:

  * **RÂ² Score:** ~0.60
  * **MSE:** ~9.22
* Visualized Actual vs Predicted Car Prices using scatter plot.
* **Files:**

  * `Car_Price_Prediction.py`
  * `README.md`
